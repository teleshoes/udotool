simple wrapper around uinput to perform some of the same functions as xdotool

udotool works on SailfishOS with some work and some other limited environments
udotool REQUIRES ROOT LEVEL ACCESS to uinput, and must be run as root on SFOS

for a more robust and feature-rich xdotool replacment using uinput,
see ydotool (a completely unrelated project, licensed under the AGPL)
